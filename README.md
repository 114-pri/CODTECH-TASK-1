## OVERVIEW OF STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

This Java program is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, control structures, and basic error checking.

1.  **User Input Handling:**                                                                                                                                        
         -> Utilizes the Scanner class to read user input from the console.                                                                                         
         -> Prompts the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operator.                                                                                         
3.  **Arithmetic Operations:**                                                                                                                                              
         -> Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.                                                                                                                                    
         ->Implements a switch statement to perform the chosen operation.                                                                                                          
        
4.  **Error Handling:**
          Checks for division by zero to prevent runtime errors and provides appropriate feedback to the user.Validates the operator and informs the user if an invalid operator is entered.
5.  **Output:**
          Displays the result of the arithmetic operation.Provides clear error messages for invalid input or operations.

6. **Conclusion:**   
              This program illustrates basic Java programming skills, including user input handling, control structures, and error checking, making it a solid demonstration of core competencies for an internship role.
